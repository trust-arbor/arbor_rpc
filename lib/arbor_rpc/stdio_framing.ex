  # The one place that knows how a JSON-RPC frame crosses an IO device.
  #
  # MCP and ACP frames are UTF-8 bytes, one per line. An Erlang IO device has
  # a character encoding of its own, picked from the process locale at VM
  # start: `:unicode` under a UTF-8 locale, `:latin1` under anything else,
  # including no locale at all. Mixing the two views corrupts frames: byte
  # reads on a unicode device return decoded codepoints as single bytes,
  # character reads on a latin1 device double-encode UTF-8, byte writes on a
  # unicode device double-encode, and character writes on a latin1 device
  # escape everything above U+00FF.
  #
  # Each view is byte-exact for valid UTF-8 as long as it matches the device:
  # characters on a unicode device, bytes on a latin1 device. So the transport
  # asks the device which it is and uses the matching calls. It does not try
  # to change the device: OTP 27 cannot switch a unicode-mode stdin to latin1
  # once the VM has started (reads then fail with `no_translation`), and the
  # device is shared with the rest of the VM anyway.
  #
  # The mode is consulted on every read and every write, not cached, because
  # the VM changes it behind the transport's back: when a unicode-mode stdio
  # meets input it cannot decode, OTP switches that device to latin1 for the
  # rest of its life (seen on OTP 27 and 28). One bad line from a peer would
  # otherwise corrupt every frame written after it. The query is a single
  # message to the device's owner, negligible next to encoding a frame.
  #
  # A read with the wrong view is not recoverable: the io server answers
  # `no_translation` and then reports end-of-file for the rest of the stream
  # (seen on OTP 27 and 28). So the view is chosen from the reported mode
  # and never probed.
  #
  # Both stdio transports use this module so the rule lives in one place.
